    <h2>How to Start Earning Money Online</h2>
    <p>
      In today's digital age, earning money online is not only possible but also becoming increasingly easy. Whether you're looking for a full-time career or just a way to earn extra income, there are plenty of opportunities available.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Freelancing: Your Skills, Your Income</h3>
    <p>
      Freelancing allows you to leverage your skills to provide services to clients around the world. Websites like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer allow you to create a profile and start bidding for projects. Popular freelancing jobs include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Graphic Design</li>
      <li>Web Development</li>
      <li>Writing & Editing</li>
      <li>Video Editing</li>
      <li>Digital Marketing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Freelancing gives you the freedom to work on projects you're passionate about, and you can earn anywhere from $10 to $100+ per hour depending on your skill set.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Affiliate Marketing: Get Paid for Promoting Products</h3>
    <p>
      Affiliate marketing involves promoting products or services and earning a commission on each sale made through your unique referral link. You don't need to create your own products, and it's one of the easiest ways to start making money online.
    </p>
    <p>
      Popular affiliate programs include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Amazon Associates</li>
      <li>ClickBank</li>
      <li>ShareASale</li>
      <li>Rakuten Marketing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Start by finding a niche you're passionate about, create a blog or YouTube channel, and start promoting products relevant to your audience. The more traffic you can drive to your referral links, the more you can earn.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Creating and Selling Online Courses</h3>
    <p>
      If you're knowledgeable in a particular subject, why not create a course and sell it online? Websites like Teachable, Thinkific, and Udemy allow you to create and sell courses on any topic you're passionate about.
    </p>
    <p>
      This can be a very profitable way to earn passive income. Once your course is created, it can continue to sell without any additional effort on your part. The more value your course provides, the more successful it will be.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Investing: Grow Your Money Over Time</h3>
    <p>
      Investing in stocks, bonds, and mutual funds can be a great way to build wealth over time. Apps like Robinhood, Acorns, and Stash make it easy for beginners to get started.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, be sure to do your research and understand the risks involved. It's important to learn about the market, follow financial news, and start with a small amount that you're willing to risk.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Selling Products Online</h3>
    <p>
      E-commerce is another powerful way to earn money online. You can sell physical products through platforms like Etsy, Shopify, or eBay, or you can sell digital products such as printables, e-books, or software.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting an online store requires an upfront investment in inventory or digital assets, but it can be a highly profitable venture once you establish a brand and customer base.
